[ ] Interest on credit cards is added to the balance monthly. If you have a 12% interest rate (0.12) then 1% interest
 will be added to the account monthly. When the balance of a credit card is accessed, check to determine if it
has been 1 month or more since the account was created or since interest was added,
 and if so, add the appropriate interest to the balance.

[ ]  Interest on savings accounts is added to the account annually at the rate of specified interestRate per year.
    That means that if I have 1000000 in a savings account with a 0.01 interest rate, 1% of 1 Million is added
    to my account after 1 year. When a savings account balance is accessed, you must determine if it has been
     1 year or more since either the account was created or since interest was added to the account, and add
     the appropriate interest to the balance if necessary.
